# Logan Merchant's Portfolio

## Purpose
A landing page that highlights the applications I have deployed and some information about myself. Having this at my disposal will entice potential employers at giving me an interview and/or job. 

## Process
I had to restart the stylesheet a second time after getting lost in the structureless way I was coding CSS rules. However, after taking the time to plan my approach for a second run at it, things went much smoother. The code could probably be optimized better, but I think that will come with more practice.
